                    <span class="step-number">1</span>
                    Set out the Othello board and give each player 30 disks. Set the square 8 x 8 board in between the players. Decide who wants to play as black and who wants to play as white. Then, give each person 30 disks, which are black on one side and white on the other. Flip all of your disks so the color you chose is face-up.

                    Players take turns placing their disks on the board. Each disk must flank an opponent's disk either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Flanked disks are flipped to the player's color. The game ends when neither player can make a move, and the player with the most disks on the board wins.
