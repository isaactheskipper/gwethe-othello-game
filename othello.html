                Othello is a strategy board game for two players (Black and White), played on an 8 by 8 board. The game traditionally begins with four discs placed in the middle of the board as shown below.

                Players take turns placing their disks on the board. Each disk must flank an opponent's disk either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Flanked disks are flipped to the player's color. The game ends when neither player can make a move, and the player with the most disks on the board wins.
                Black must place a black disc on the board, in such a way that there is at least one straight (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) occupied line between the new disc and another black disc, with one or more contiguous white pieces between them. 
                In the starting position, Black has the following 4 options indicated by translucent discs:
